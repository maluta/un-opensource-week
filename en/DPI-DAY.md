#### **Amandeep Singh Gill - UN Under-Secretary-General and Special Envoy**
*   **Core Message:** DPI is a powerful, architected collaboration built on open-source principles that can achieve massive scale for public good without ruling out profit.
*   **Key Examples of DPI Success:**
    *   **India:** Financial inclusion soared from 35% to nearly 80% through Aadhaar and Jandhan.
    *   **Estonia:** e-Government saves 2% of GDP annually.
    *   **Brazil:** The PIX payments platform delivered over $5.7 billion in savings in its first year.
    *   **Kazakhstan:** A comprehensive digital family card system ensures no family in need is left behind.
*   **Critical Theme:** Trust is essential for DPI adoption. This requires building in safeguards and human rights protections "by design," not as an afterthought.
*   **Future Focus:** Interoperability, the interface of DPI with AI, and experience sharing are crucial next steps.

#### **H.E. Minister Sigmund Freund - Dominican Republic**
*   **Core Message:** DPI is a test of values, designed to make the state more agile, accountable, and human. The Dominican Republic is choosing to build internal public sector capacity rather than relying on external consultants.
*   **Dominican Republic's Strategy:**
    1.  **Human Talent Development:** Building skills within the civil service.
    2.  **Government Reference Architecture:** Using DPI principles for interoperability and scalability.
    3.  **People-Centered Digital Services:** Secure, proactive, and accessible services.
*   **Key Initiatives:** Citing concrete examples like X-Road for interoperability and Soy yo RD, a user-controlled digital wallet.

#### **Vilas Dar - President, Patrick J. McGovern Foundation**
*   **Core Message:** There is no such thing as "neutral technology." Technology embeds values and decisions about power. Peace is no longer just about treaties; it is about building reliable infrastructure and systems that create trust.
*   **Call to Action for Technologists:** Reject the idea of building in isolation. Embrace multinational collaboration on open standards and shared governance.
*   **Vision:** DPI must be designed with intention to be just and humane. "Peace is a design choice."

#### **H.E. Dr. Bosun Tijani - Minister of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy, Nigeria**
*   **Core Message:** DPI offers a historic opportunity to rebuild trust between citizens and their governments, moving from a transactional state to a responsive one.
*   **DPI as a New Social Contract:** It's not just an evolution of e-government but a foundational layer for innovation and service delivery at scale.
*   **Nigeria's 5-Point Strategy:**
    1.  Investing in foundational infrastructure (connectivity, talent).
    2.  Establishing strong legal and governance frameworks.
    3.  Championing open standards and modular design.
    4.  Activating a vibrant DPI ecosystem for startups and innovators.
    5.  Maintaining a "moral clarity" that puts people at the center.

### **2. Panel: "Learning Across Borders"**

This panel explored global collaboration, challenges, and best practices in DPI implementation.

*   **Daniel Morenzi (East African Community):** Highlighted challenges like fragmented laws and low internet penetration, but also major successes like the rise of mobile money and real-time cross-border customs data exchange. Emphasized linking projects to universities to build local capacity.
*   **Yolanda Martinez (World Bank):** Stressed that success requires political support, institutional capacity, and digital skills. The World Bank is financing comprehensive digital operations and fostering knowledge sharing, such as a new consortium to build a regional DPI stack in Latin America.
*   **Tiffany Ferris (Drupal Foundation):** Drew lessons from the 25-year-old open-source Drupal project: the importance of transparent governance, investment in collaboration tools, and strong community norms for conflict resolution. Noted that sustainable funding for maintenance (not just new features) is a critical challenge for open-source projects.
*   **Mark Lepage (Asian Development Bank):** Focused on the financial challenges of DPI, including a lack of cost transparency, unsustainable funding models, and high ongoing operational costs. ADB is working with partners to address these issues through smart financing and capacity development.
*   **Sheila Warren (Project Liberty Institute):** Argued that DPI is a continuous *process*, not a finite *project*. It must be centered on citizen empowerment. She cited survey data showing deep public concern over data privacy, reinforcing the need to embed safeguards from the start and constantly adapt to user needs.

### **3. Audience Q&A Highlights**

Key questions from the audience focused on:
1.  **Local Capacity:** How to empower local technical providers to build and support DPI.
2.  **Citizen Trust:** How to overcome the perception that digital ID systems are politically motivated, especially around elections.
3.  **Scaling with Open Source:** How open-source tools can scale impact in sectors like health and education in low-resource settings.

### **4. Conclusion & Next Steps**

The session concluded with instructions for six co-creative breakout sessions on topics like safeguards, financing, and AI. The main goal of these sessions was to develop concrete **"calls to action"** to be presented at the **Global DPI Summit in South Africa in November 2024**, directly shaping the global agenda.


Of course. Here is a structured summary of the second half of the DPI Day session from the provided transcript.

### **Event Overview (Part 2)**

The second half of DPI Day focused on sharing the outcomes of the co-creation breakout sessions and a deep-dive panel on DPI implementation in Africa. The key objective was to synthesize discussions into actionable insights and calls to action for the upcoming Global DPI Summit.

### **1. Message from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)**

A video message from **Thomas Lamanaskus, Deputy Secretary-General of the ITU**, highlighted the agency's commitment to open source as a vital enabler of DPI.

*   **Key Initiatives:**
    *   **GovStack:** Promotes open-source blueprints for modernizing public services.
    *   **Open Source Programme Offices (OSPOs):** A joint ITU-UNDP initiative helping governments (e.g., Kenya, Trinidad and Tobago) build institutional capacity for open source.
    *   **AI for Good:** An initiative to make AI a common good, with an upcoming summit in Geneva.
*   **Core Message:** The ITU practices what it preaches, having led the creation of the UN's own open-source policy framework. Open source allows nations to control their "own digital destiny" by reducing proprietary lock-in and investing in homegrown talent.

### **2. Breakout Session Share-Outs**

This segment, moderated by **Ora from Codevelop**, featured organizers and participants reporting back on the key discussions and "calls to action" from each of the six breakout sessions.

| Breakout Session Topic | Key Discussion Points | Call(s) to Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. DPI Safeguards** | Presented new tools for assessing and measuring safeguard implementation. Country representatives (Dominican Republic, South Africa) shared practical experiences, stressing the importance of design to avoid institutionalizing harm. | **Gather feedback** on the new tools, **simplify adoption pathways**, integrate AI considerations, and get more countries to test and refine the framework. |
| **2. Data Protection in DPI** | Open source is a key enabler but not sufficient on its own; user trust is paramount. Privacy-by-design and strong, well-funded oversight bodies are critical for enforcement. | Ensure DPI systems are trusted and rights-respecting by **embedding data protection enforcement from the start** and fostering dialogue for institutional accountability. |
| **3. Evidence for Safety** | Case studies (Kenya, India, Brazil) revealed that DPI systems can create new, unaddressed risks (e.g., disinformation). Redress mechanisms must be well-designed, resourced, and accessible. | **Establish an "observatory of emerging risks"** to track and address issues proactively. Develop decentralized communication strategies to engage stakeholders. |
| **4. Co-creating Trustworthy DPI (Digital Sovereignty)** | Digital sovereignty doesn't mean isolation but making conscious choices about what to build locally vs. leverage globally. Citizen engagement is key to ensuring democratic digital governance. | **Define the layers of "digital sovereignty"** more clearly and **leverage multi-stakeholder partnerships** for concrete, ecosystem-wide implementation. |
| **5. Learning from Open Source (for Smaller States)**| Open source is a path to sovereignty. The focus should be on building communities and local capacity (investing in people), not just procuring software. Legal and procurement barriers remain a major challenge. | **Invest in people**, support the private ecosystem for open-source tools, encourage governments to **share resources** (e.g., translated documentation), and **innovate on public procurement** models. |
| **6. Breaking Barriers (Digital ID & Payments)**| **Digital ID:** Poses risks of exclusion, tracking, and conflict with societal norms. It must be contextualized and not a one-size-fits-all solution. **Digital Payments:** Face challenges with the enabling environment, competition, and user intimidation (complexity). | A core principle for Digital ID should be a **"digital-first, but not a digital-only" approach** to avoid excluding those who cannot or will not engage digitally. |

### **3. Panel: Empowering DPI Implementation Across Africa**

This panel explored the unique challenges and opportunities for DPI on the African continent.

*   **Keynote Remarks (Traveen Rabinath, South Africa G20 Presidency):** DPI is a top priority for the G20. Emphasized the need for "tailor-made solutions, by Africa, for Africa" to achieve technical sovereignty and avoid vendor lock-in.

*   **Panel Discussion:**
    *   **Unique African Context:** An audience poll and the panelists highlighted the continent's youth-led innovation, significant infrastructure constraints, profound digital inclusion challenges, and immense diversity (54 countries, ~3,000 cultures).
    *   **Key Challenges:** A lack of trust in both systems and local capacity; regulatory fragmentation; and a need for a common, human-centric understanding of what DPI aims to achieve.
    *   **Key Opportunities:** DPI can empower the youth and MSMEs, giving them access to credit and regional markets under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA). Africa's lack of legacy systems in some areas provides a unique chance to build interoperable systems "right from the start."
    *   **Most Critical Need:** Panelists unanimously agreed that **capacity building** and **community engagement** are the two areas requiring the most urgent and sustained support.
